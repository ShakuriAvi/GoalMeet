# GoalMeet
The purpose of the app is to connect football fans in order to meet in teams or individuals and hold football games.

There are two types of users in the app:
* Soccer Team Managers: This is a user who created a team.
* The second type is a user who is looking for a soccer team.

Each user has different permissions: 
* The team manager is the only one who can confirm the admission of new players to the team,
schedule games with other teams and determining the end result after the team meeting.
* A player who does not have a team he manages can send requests to other teams to make a switch between teams.
The program is implemented by working with Firebase, real-time updates between users ×©nd various photo packages designed by me and by various creators on the internet.
Each user can select a profile picture and change it.

Users can have conversations with each other through real-time chat.
Through chat users can determine where and when to meet, request different requests from football team managers and talk with different users.
